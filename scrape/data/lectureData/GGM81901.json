  "overview": "There are several ways to transform information into visual representations, with the major ones being graphs, information visualizations, and infographics. This course focuses on designing and utilizing infographics. Creating an infographic is not merely a task of replacing numbers with graphs; rather, it involves designing a message through a deep understanding of the subject’s essence. It also requires a strong sense of abstract concept design. The course introduces the differences between the three major methods of representing information and provides an understanding of infographics by comparing them with other visualization approaches.",
  "objectives": "First, the students need to understand the characteristics of each approach to visualizing the three types of data and the differences in their respective fields of application. To create an infographic, one must identify a problem to focus on, determine the message one wants to convey, gather the necessary data and information, extract the core idea, and design an appropriate visual representation. Achieving this requires a clear understanding of the essence of the subject. By examining multiple examples in class, students are expected to develop this critical insight.",
  "teachingMethod": "The class is conducted in seminar style, with explanations followed by questions and discussion. Students are required to bring their own laptop computers to the presentations of their own assignments.",
  "notes": "This class is part of the English program and is conducted entirely in English. Students are expected to participate in discussions in English as well. Japanese students may enroll in this course if they are able to meet this requirement.",
  "preparation": "Students are required to work on the assignments given each time (about 120 min. for preparation).",
  "evaluation": "The grade will be based on the quality of the student's work on the assignment (60%) and the quality of the student's participation in class discussions (40%). A score of 60 or above is considered passing. Feedback on the assignment will be given in class after the students have presented their work.",
